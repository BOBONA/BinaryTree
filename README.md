# BinaryTree
This was made for my high school algorithms class. The BinaryTree package has a self-contained binary search tree implementation. The main class has an interactive console app for testing out the tree.

Auto-generated documentation (might be out of date) is in the javadoc folder. See javadoc\allclasses-frame.html for the class list.

A prebuilt InteractiveTree.jar is also available for the test program.
